![](./img/print.png)

Are you tired of playing your favorite Windows games on Linux with subpar performance? Look no further! OpenDX is an open-source project aimed at bringing the power of DirectX to the Linux platform, without depending on Wine.

With OpenDX, you can finally enjoy the full gaming experience on Linux, just like you would on Windows. Our project is still in development, but we have already made great progress, including a fully functional "dxdiag" window that works on one screen.

We believe that OpenDX has the potential to revolutionize gaming on Linux and we need your help to make it a reality. If you are a developer, we welcome you to contribute to the project and make it even better. If you are just a user, you can support us by giving us a star on GitHub and spreading the word about OpenDX.

Join us in our mission to bring the best gaming experience to Linux. Together, we can make it happen!
