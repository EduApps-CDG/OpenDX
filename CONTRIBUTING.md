# Contributing
This guide shows how to prepare your environment to contribute for OpenDX.

## Dependencies
First, install these dependencies (older versions might work, but it's not guaranteed).

| Dependency | Version |
|:-|-:|
|[`cmake`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/kinetic/cmake)|`3.25.1`|
|[`libgtk-4-dev`](https://packages.ubuntu.com/kinetic/libgtk-4-dev)|`4.10.1`|


## Building and running
These are the same universal steps for cmake:

```sh
cd build
cmake ..

# run dxdiag
./dxdiag
```
